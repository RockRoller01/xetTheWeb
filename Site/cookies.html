	<h1>What do they do?</h1>
	<p>This website uses cookies to keep track of some of your preferences, such as your preferred theme.</p>
	<p>All the cookies used here are made by Xet, and are not used for any advertisement purposes.</p>

	<h1>For the record.</h1>
	<p>And for the sake of transparency, this page will also explain what each and every Cookie on this site does.</p>
	<h2>The "theme" cookie.</h2>
	<p>This cookie checks what is your OS default theme, and uses that information to choose the correct theme on the page.</p>
	<p>This cookie has an expiry date of 7 Days.</p>
	<h2>The "rememberTheme" cookie.</h2>
	<p>This one has a similar function, once you click on the Theme Switcher button, it sets a cookie with you preferred theme, and the site will use that instead of your OS theme.</p>
	<p>This cookie has an expiry date of 7 Days.</p>
	<h2>The "disclaimerDismissed" cookie.</h2>
	<p>As you may have noticed, there's a little disclaimer at the bottom of the page that says this website uses cookies.</p>
	<p>Once you click the "Got it." button on the disclaimer, it will create a cookie that will tell the website you already read that disclaimer and will it not show up again.</p>
	<p>This cookie has an expiry date of 1 Year.</p>

	<h1>I don't like cookies.</h1>
	<p>I get it, Cookies are not for everyone, or they may be blocked by your browser by default, but there's no problem at all if that's the case, here they are only used to keep track of some of your settings, and to get rid of that annoying (but necessary) disclaimer.</p>
